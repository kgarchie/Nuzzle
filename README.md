# Nuzzle

This simple CLI program helps devs get started with either a Nuxt + Drizzle or Next + Drizzle project

To get started, simply run the following command. The setup wizard will guide you through installation.
``` bash
npx nuzzle

This is a very early version, more features are being worked on. Version 1 will release soon
