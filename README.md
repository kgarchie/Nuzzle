# Nuzzle

This is a set up wizard to help devs set up drizzle

We are working of features to set up Nuxt/Next with it. Kind of like Sidebase, with options to select the database(those supported by [drizzle](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)), and automatically bootstrapping it to the project. Later on, we'll develop our custom ORM based on [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) Syntax and Drizzle functionality, called [Prizzle](https://github.com/kgarchie/Prizzle.git)

This project's aim is to make getting started with Drizzle a breeze. It is not yet complete.

A demo exists for now using npx
``` bash
npx nuzzle
```
